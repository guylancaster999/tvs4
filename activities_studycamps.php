                       &nbsp;&nbsp;TVS organises short, residential study camps led by volunteer teachers from the UK, at the <a href="http://www.hobbiton.co.za/">Hobbiton Outdoor Education Centre</a> in Hogsback. 
							Some 100 children a year benefit from these camps. The children's teachers are fully involved the study camps, alongside the TVS volunteer teachers. During the week the teachers and learners work in subject areas such as science, English, maths, art and drama. The Tyume teachers are shown new methodologies and then implement them with support from the UK volunteer teachers. For the children, the best part of the camp is the outdoor activities! They experience the thrill of the high wire, a night hike in the woods, a barbecue and other team-building activities, as well as improving their spoken and written English. Old fears are conquered, new friendships formed and, most important of all, the children discover that nothing is beyond them.

							February   16th 2015 saw the start of a week-long Study Camp for primary-aged   children at <a href="http://www.hobbiton.co.za">Hobbiton Outdoor Activity Centre</a>. 
							The  camp  was run by a team of four teachers from Bexley, led by Jerry Parsons,   who has visited Tyume before. The camp ran along the usual lines, with two cohorts, each of fifty children, from different primary schools. The focus was on improving the children's English language fluency and   competence. This was done through drama, playscripts, interviews and   oral history, guided by the interests and expertise of the volunteer teachers. The children alternated their days between outdoor activities   run by Hobbiton staff and English language learning with the UK volunteers. Each group of children was accompanied by a teacher from   their own school, so the teachers could also join in and see how the   children could enjoy learning!

							<h4>TVS Study Camp December 2014 – hard work and fun!</h4>
							<div style="float:right"><img src="img/sc014_140.jpg" alt="IT Study Camp" class="img-responsive img-rounded  img_pad"> </div>
							December's study camp was a departure from the usual pattern – and an unqualified success as far as the participants were concerned. It involved an older age group than usual – school leavers from 5 secondary schools in Tyume Valley. The first week was held at our usual study camp venue, Hobbiton Outdoor Centre in Hogsback.
							This was followed by a second, non-residential week in premises loaned from Fort Hare University in Alice. The fortnight's programme was built around the themes of 'Healthy Living' and 'Preparation for the World of Work'. It included an introduction to MS Office; internet searching, emails and graphics; building CVs; and formatting letters and documents.
							<br/>
							<br/>
							Students' motivation was high; they viewed the experience as a valuable opportunity and performed accordingly. By the end of the two weeks they formed a cohesive social group who enjoyed each other's company and supported each other well.

							Steph Gallier and Liz Button, who led the camp, attributed the success to a number of factors. Careful planning beforehand, both in the UK and in Tyume, included briefing participating schools and students so they knew what to expect (and what was expected of them). 
							The involvement of TVS' IT teacher Vuvu Tomi and assistants Bongiwe and Nontombi contributed to the study camp's high staffing levels; they worked hard and took a genuine interest in the students' success. Extending the study camp for a second week allowed teaching and skills to be reinforced and was again appreciated by the students. Photos on Facebook and videos of presentations provided further reinforcement.
