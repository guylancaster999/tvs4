The project has grown from the initial training of 17 families in 4 villages in February 2007, to 273 families in 10 villages.
Most of the home gardens are maintained by elderly grannies who are not only supporting themselves, but also their AIDS-orphaned grandchildren and other family members afflicted with AIDS.</td>
