For the last ten years TVS has organised short volunteer-led residential study camps at the <a href="http://www.hobbiton.co.za/">Hobbiton Outdoor Education Centre</a> in Hogsback. 
Some 100 children a year benefit from these camps.
<br/>
<br/>
An integral part of the study camps for students is the involvement of their own teachers in running the courses alongside the TVS volunteers. During the week the teachers and learners work in various subject areas such as science, English, maths, art and drama. The teachers are shown new methodologies and then implement them with the support of the volunteers.
<br/>
<br/>
For the children the best part of the camp is the outdoor activities! They experience the thrill of the high wire, a night hike in the woods, a barbecue and other team building activities as well as improving their spoken and written English. Old fears are conquered, new friendships formed and, most important of all, the children discover that nothing is beyond them.

<strong> October 2013 </strong>
<br/>
Volunteer Liz Button joined Margaret Kiloh for a week-long Study Camp involving two groups of 50 children aged 10-15 years. The focus for the week was on improving their reading and speaking in English. The lessons used 'Story Sacks' donated by a partner school in the UK. The Sacks contained story books and props for re-telling stories and were specifically aimed at children learning English as a second language. Alongside these lessons, the children took part in a range of outdoor games and challenges designed to improve physical skills, team work and self-confidence.

<br/><strong>Autumn 2014</strong>
<br/>The 2014 study camp will take place week beginning 1st December (the end of the school year). For the first time, the Study Camp will cater for school leavers, with a focus on improving their IT skills in readiness for workplace or college.   Liz Button and Steph Gallier will lead the Camp, with support from a new volunteer James Turner, Vuvu and Vicky Riley.   Hobbiton has been booked for 30 students; these are likely to be mainly girls as many of the boys will be away from home at this time. 
<br/>
<br/><strong>Plans for 2015</strong>
<br/>A Study Camp for primary-aged children is planned for week beginning February 16th. This camp will be run by a team of three or four teachers from Bexley led by Jerry Parsons, who has visited Tyume before.
The camp is expected to run along the usual lines of two cohorts of fifty children from different primary schools. The focus will be on improving English language fluency and competence.  This will be done through drama, playscripts, interviews and oral history, depending on the interests and expertise of the volunteer teachers. The children will alternate their days between outdoor activities run by Hobbiton staff and English language learning with the UK volunteers.<?php print pageclass::foot0();?>
