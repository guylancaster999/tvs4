<h3>Staff Exchanges</h3>
The expectation is that practising classroom teachers visit partner schools rather than Headteachers or Principals, unless they have a significant teaching role in their schools.
<br/>
<br/>
Visiting and hosting provide staff with the opportunity to strengthen professional relationships and experience partners’ teaching and learning practices, opportunities and everyday challenges
<br/>
<br/>

<li> Teachers familiarise themselves with background information about their partner’s school, country, culture and education system
</li>
<li> Teachers are made aware and agree about how costs (internal travel, accommodation, meals etc.) will be covered during visit. The Co-ordinators need to ensure this is done.
</li>
<li> Hosting teachers need to be aware of dietary or religious requirements, health issues of visitors. Agreement is needed as to whether hotels or staff hosts the visitors?
</li>
<li> Co-ordinators need to have sorted out passports, visas, insurance etc. in good time.
</li>
</ul>
During the visit:

</li>
</ul>
After the visit:
