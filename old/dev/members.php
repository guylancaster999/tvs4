TVS is a registered charity. Details of our governance and copies of our Annual Report and accounts can be found on <a href="http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk">the Charity Commission website</a>. There are six trustees, all of whom are experienced professionals who have spent a lifetime working in the education sector or children's services. All of our trustees are actively involved with the project and visit South Africa, at their own expense, on a regular basis.
The TVS committee consists of five trustees plus others elected or co-opted on an annual basis:
