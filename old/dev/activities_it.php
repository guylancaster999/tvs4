				Proficiency in IT is essential to improving employment opportunities, especially in areas like Tyume Valley with high unemployment rates. 
				Our IT programme introduces primary school children to basic IT/keyboard skills. 
				TVS IT teacher Vuvu Tomi and classroom assistant Nontombi currently provide weekly sessions in 9 primary and 2 secondary schools; the laptops they use have also been provided through TVSâ€™ fundraising activities. 
				Other schools in the valley are keen to join the IT programme.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				We are also supporting Vuvu Tomi to obtain a full teaching qualification, which will improve her own employment opportunities.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				Students in the IT programme are tested annually. 
				Each year the majority pass the tests in Word and basic keyboard skills. 
				However, the tests also highlight the challenges experienced by many students, particularly their poor reading and writing skills in English, which is used for both on-line activities and classroom IT teaching. 
				Other challenges include unfamiliarity with formal testing and electricity power cuts that disrupt classes.
