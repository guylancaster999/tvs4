		 Once your school has decided to work towards a partnership with a Tyume Valley school, it’s important that: all staff are aware and supportive of the initiative; the partnership is integrated into your school’s improvement/development plan; there is more than one named member of staff leading the activity; and the partnership supports your school’s curriculum priorities.
			<ul>
			<li>It’s helpful when starting out to link with another local school that already has an overseas partnership. They will have useful experience and advice around practicalities and know what has worked and what hasn’t. Perhaps invite a teacher with experience of linking to a staff meeting? TVS can also provide a speaker.</li>
			<li>Involve governors and inform parents of your plans.
			</li>
			<li>Keep the focus of the partnership on learning, not providing resources for the Tyume Valley school. (It may be appropriate for a parent or local community group to take on any fundraising activities at a later date.)
			</li>
			<li>If you decide to contact any of the schools in Tyume Valley (see <a href="partnershipsTyume.php">Tyume Valley schools seeking partnership with a UK school</a>), please let TVS know so that we can support you.
			</li>
			<li>Create a plan of action: consider applying for a British Council Reciprocal Visit Grant or working towards the International School Award.
			</li>
			</ul>
