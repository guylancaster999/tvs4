&nbsp;&nbsp;TVS organises short, residential study camps led by volunteer teachers from the UK, at the <a href="http://www.hobbiton.co.za/">Hobbiton Outdoor Education Centre</a> in Hogsback. 
Some 100 children a year benefit from these camps. The children's teachers are fully involved the study camps, alongside the TVS volunteer teachers. During the week the teachers and learners work in subject areas such as science, English, maths, art and drama. The Tyume teachers are shown new methodologies and then implement them with support from the UK volunteer teachers. For the children, the best part of the camp is the outdoor activities! They experience the thrill of the high wire, a night hike in the woods, a barbecue and other team-building activities, as well as improving their spoken and written English. Old fears are conquered, new friendships formed and, most important of all, the children discover that nothing is beyond them.
<h4>TVS' IT programme – evidence of success</h4>
We are increasingly introducing measures to demonstrate the effectiveness of our work in Tyume. In November 2013 we introduced basic tests for our IT learners. There were 3 tests with different levels of difficulty, depending on the amount of teaching learners had received and their abilities; all the tests examined their knowledge of Microsoft Word.
<br/>
<br/>
In September 2014 many of these learners took the test at the next level of difficulty. The pass rate was set at 65%; all learners reaching this were rewarded with an 'Achievement Certificate'. Additional awards were given to those achieving 65% - 76% (bronze/red star); 77% - 89% (silver star); 90% - 99% (gold star); 100% (2x gold stars).

<h4>TVS Study Camp December 2014 – hard work and fun!</h4>
December's study camp was a departure from the usual pattern – and an unqualified success as far as the participants were concerned. It involved an older age group than usual – school leavers from 5 secondary schools in Tyume Valley. The first week was held at our usual study camp venue, Hobbiton Outdoor Centre in Hogsback. This was followed by a second, non-residential week in premises loaned from Fort Hare University in Alice. The fortnight's programme was built around the themes of 'Healthy Living' and 'Preparation for the World of Work'. It included an introduction to MS Office; internet searching, emails and graphics; building CVs; and formatting letters and documents.
<br/>
<br/>

Students' motivation was high; they viewed the experience as a valuable opportunity and performed accordingly. By the end of the two weeks they formed a cohesive social group who enjoyed each other's company and supported each other well.
<br/>
<br/>
Steph Gallier and Liz Button who led the camp attributed the success to a number of factors. Careful planning beforehand, both in the UK and in Tyume, included briefing participating schools and students so they knew what to expect (and what was expected of them). The involvement of TVS' IT teacher Vuvu Tomi and assistants Bongiwe and Nontombi contributed to the study camp's high staffing levels; they worked hard and took a genuine interest in the students' success. Extending the study camp for a second week allowed teaching and skills to be reinforced and was again appreciated by the students. Photos on Facebook and videos of presentations provided further reinforcement.

<h4>Plans for 2015</h4>
 A Study Camp for primary-aged children is planned for week beginning February 16th. This camp will be run by a team of three or four teachers from Bexley, led by Jerry Parsons, who has visited Tyume before. The camp is expected to run along the usual lines of two cohorts of fifty children from different primary schools. The focus will be on improving English language fluency and competence. This will be done through drama, playscripts, interviews and oral history, depending on the interests and expertise of the volunteer teachers. The children will alternate their days between outdoor activities run by Hobbiton staff and English language learning with the UK volunteers.
 <br/>
 Thanks to the input of TVS volunteers Steph and Liz, plus UK volunteer James Turner, the study camp cost only £4,000 – incredible value for money. This included the supply of USB sticks, lanyards, name badges, pens, pencils, notebooks and laminated certificates for the students, who were also given money to make their own transport arrangements to Alice for the second week. A further outcome was help for Vuvu Tomi in planning lessons and observing a range of different teaching methods.

We hope to repeat this successful experience again!
