                &nbsp;&nbsp;Proficiency in IT is an essential part of improving employment opportunities for young people in South Africa, especially in areas like Tyume with its high unemployment rates. For the past 8 years TVS has provided teaching in basic IT/keyboard skills to increasing numbers of children in the valley. The IT programme is now a core part of TVS' activities. It reflects the efforts of the TVS co-ordinator Vicky Riley in organising timetables and transport and providing support and mentoring for our IT teacher Vuvu Tomi and her two classroom assistants Bongiwe and Nontombi.  
				<br/>
				<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2014 we taught over 200 children in 9 primary and 3 secondary schools in Tyume. Vuvu, Bongiwe and Nontombi travel between the schools, transporting laptops (which have also been provided through TVS' fundraising activities); many of the students now have access to modern laptops. TVS also provides IT teaching to a small group of adult learners through the <a href="http://www.jikani.com">Jikani project</a> at Hogsback. 
				We are also supporting Vuvu Tomi in obtaining a full teaching qualification herself, which will improve her own future employment opportunities.

				<h4>Testing pupils' IT</h4>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;IT students are tested each September. The tests review students' proficiency in Word and basic keyboard skills. In 2014, in 5 out of the 7 primary schools and both secondary schools, over 50% of the children passed their tests. In two of the primary schools, well over 80% of children passed, as did three-quarters of the children in each of the secondary schools. In the two primary schools with less good results, most of the children were in the youngest grades and had only recently begun to receive IT teaching. 
				<hr/>
				<h4>Challenges in Tyume </h4>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;The IT tests also highlight the major problems facing students in Tyume. The most significant challenge for many is their poor grasp of reading and writing in English, which is used for both on-line activities and classroom IT teaching. TVS is already tackling this with our English language programme in the Valley schools. A few children struggled with the formal IT testing itself; we hope that regular IT tests will get them used to the formal tests which will become increasingly important later in their school careers. Other challenges include the lack of regular electricity in some schools, which impedes classes. And of course there are challenges in teaching large groups of children, as this means limited access to laptops during IT classes.
