						 Each year we recruit and organise a team of volunteers who pay their own expenses and airfares to South Africa to run our children's camp and workshops for teachers in the Tyume Valley.
						Most of our volunteers are teachers but some projects need the help of volunteers with specific skills who may not be qualified teachers. 
						If you have a transferable skill to offer such as sports coaching, music, ICT or art there may be opportunities for you to pass them on and have a great time while you do so.

						<h3>What is involved in volunteering to go to South Africa?</h3>
						The volunteers usually visit the Tyume Valley during the UK school holidays. 
						Those who join the project are responsible for funding their own flights. 
						Accommodation and basic food costs during the project are provided but optional weekend trips must be paid for. 
						Volunteers are asked to take an active part in the planning and organisation of the visit and in fund raising.
						<br/>
						<br/>
						<h3>What can you expect on a trip?</h3>
						Everyone usually meets up at East London and then we travel together to the Tyume Valley. 
						Accommodation is arranged beforehand and may range from very basic rooms in a village to small hotels. Activities usually include workshops for teachers, activity weeks for the students and visits to schools. 
						There is also time for some relaxation at the weekend and some volunteers decide to stay a little longer and take the opportunity to have a holiday.
						<br/>
						<br/>
						<h3>Volunteering in the UK</h3>
						If you can't go to South Africa there are still things that you can do in the UK. Supporters have collected books and musical instruments and organised car boot sales and concerts to raise money for equipment for the Resource Centre. 
						Other ways that you could help include taking responsibility for publicity such as the TVS Newsletter, taking responsibility for our membership database, organising local fundraising events and activities and recruiting new supporters.
