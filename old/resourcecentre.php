In 2005, TVS was offered accommodation at Yamala Primary School. 
We set up a Resource Centre so that all the schools in the Tyume Valley would have equal access to computers, books and other resources. 
Containers funded by TVS brought donated books and equipment from the UK. The Resource Centre now provides a library, computer lab and AV/meeting room. 
The Centre is the base for teacher training and for our main teaching programmes.
