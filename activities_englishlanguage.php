						&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2011, we began a programme of supplementary English  Language courses for primary school teachers and children.Â 
						TVS funds two South African Teacher Trainers, who train and support teachers from Tyume schools at the Yamala Resource  Centre.
						Selected local teachers are trained to use innovative English Language teaching methods in order to improve their skills and confidence in teaching English. 
						We then support the teachers in putting this learning into practice back in their own schools and mentor them so that they can eventually take on mentoring fellow teachers themselves. 
							<br/>
							<br/>
							During 2014, teachers from 9 schools, and over 50 children were involved. 
							<h4>Regular testing </h4>
							Students taking part are tested each year, using a standard assessment package. 
							In 2012, the Grade 3 learners achieved and increase of 51% above the base-line assessment. In 2013 the same group of learners, now in Grade 4, together achieved an average of 82% on the Cambridge &quot;Fun for Starters&quot; end-course assessment. 
							In 2014 a mixed group of Grade 4 and 5 learners achieved 19% above the base-line assessment. 
							<h4>Teacher feedback </h4>
							Teachers involved in the English language programme enjoy the course and learn from it: 
							<ul>
							<li>'I enjoyed very much teaching Grades 4 and 5; they worked very hard... I wish this course could start next year because it helps children to speak freely in English.' </li>
							<li>I did enjoy the classes. I pray we get sponsors for next year. I gained something and share with teachers at my school.' </li>
							<li>'The project was good. Our Grade 5s are going more than the Grade 6s! It was worthwhile...' </li></ul>
