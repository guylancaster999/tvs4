					  <h3>Suggestions for joint projects</h3>
					  <ul>
					  <li>Each school produces a poster on what they know about the partners’ country, region, village or country at the outset of the link. Then after researching their partner’s country etc. they produce a second poster. This allows for discussion on stereotypes and realities of initial perceptions.
						</li>
						<li>Introductory letter exchange- email exchange using school addresses (not personal email of personal address.) Teachers identify buddy partners.
						</li>
						<li>Pupils produce a PowerPoint introducing themselves and their school to each other. These are then exchanged. This can be on a flash drive or CD if internet link is weak.
						</li>
						<li>Pupils produce and exchange a weekly diary with illustrations.
						</li>
						<li> A whole class can produce a hand book about their school and its locality.
						</li>
						<li> Schools exchange a dozen pictures of their school /locality. Partners then annotate picture asking key questions. Partner school writes answers and returns them to the school generating the questions - either by email or letter.
						</li>
						<li> Mapping skills- pupils plot and draw their journey to school.
						</li>
						<li> Both schools log the weather locally and each week gives a summary of key facts gathered to each other.
						</li>
						<li> Pupils produce simple Xhosa- English phrasebook. With illustrations where necessary.
						</li>
						<li> Each partner produces a cook book of basic local recipes.
						</li>
						<li> Bi-lingual story exchange- Learners create stories that can be shared with younger children in both English and Xhosa.
						</li>
						<li> Partners produce a Guide Book to their own area and exchange them.	</li>
						<li> Projects can be developed that link themes from the curriculum of each school- for example; Water and the water cycle. In Maths for example – problem solving.	</li>
						</ul>
