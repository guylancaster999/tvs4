						TVS encourages links between UK and Tyume Valley schools. 
						Formal links – partnerships – between UK and Tyume Valley schools can help raise educational standards in Tyume Valley and promote the professional development of teachers. 
						Educational objectives are central to school linking; any fund-raising activities are secondary. 
						TVS has helped a number of schools to set up partnerships with UK schools and enabled teacher exchanges between the partner schools. 
						<br/>
						Partnerships between UK and Tyume schools have many benefits:
						<ul>
							<li>They enable children in both schools to share experiences and learn about life in another country.</li>
							<li>They offer opportunities and funding for teacher exchanges that enhance teachers’ experience and expand their skills.</li>
							<li>They offer a focus for many aspects of the curriculum eg geography, religion, diversity, social justice, peace and conflict.</li>
							<li>They can leave lasting legacies in the lives of children and teachers in both countries.</li>
						</ul>
						TVS will be delighted to help set up partnerships between <a href="http://www.tvschools.org.uk/partnershipsTyume.php">Tyume Valley Schools</a> and schools in the UK. Telephone and internet connections in Tyume are not always reliable, so please contact Jim Lewis <a title="Email Jim Lewis" href="mailto:headlewis2001@yahoo.co.uk">headlewis2001@yahoo.co.uk</a> Tel: 0114 2509174, if you need help to contact a Tyume Valley school.
