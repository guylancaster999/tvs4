TVS relies heavily on volunteers to run our study camps for children and workshops for teachers in Tyume Valley. 
Most volunteers are teachers, but volunteers with specific skills such as sports coaching, music, IT or art are also welcome.
						<br/>
						<br/>
						<h3>What is involved in volunteering to go to South Africa?</h3>
Volunteers usually visit the Tyume Valley during the UK school holidays. 
Volunteers are responsible for funding their own flights and accommodation. 
Volunteers are asked to take an active part in the planning and organisation of the visit and in fund raising.

						<br/>
						<br/>
						<h3>What can you expect on a trip?</h3>
						Everyone usually meets up at East London and then we travel together to the Tyume Valley. 
						Accommodation is arranged beforehand and may range from very basic rooms in a village to small hotels. Activities usually include workshops for teachers, activity weeks for the students and visits to schools. 
						There is also time for some relaxation at the weekend and some volunteers decide to stay a little longer and take the opportunity to have a holiday.
 						<br/>
						<br/>
						<h3>Volunteering in the UK</h3>
						If you can't go to South Africa there are still things that you can do in the UK. Supporters have collected books and musical instruments and organised car boot sales and concerts to raise money for equipment for the Resource Centre. 
						Other ways that you could help include taking responsibility for publicity such as the TVS Newsletter, taking responsibility for our membership database, organising local fundraising events and activities and recruiting new supporters.
