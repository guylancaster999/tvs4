					  <li>Partnerships go through a series of stages as they develop.
						<ul>
							<li>Initial contact</li>
							<li>Agreeing means and regularity of contact</li>
							<li>Identifying mutual curriculum topics that fit with Global Education</li>
							<li> Making a formal agreement</li>
							<li> Organising possible staff exchanges</li>
						</ul>

						<li>A school in Tyume Valley wishes to form a partnership and informs TVS. It identifies what it seeks to gain from its link.</li>
						<li>Tyume Valley Schools helps to identify a suitable UK partner school.</li>
						<li>Partnership/link Co-ordinators are identified by the Headteacher/Principal in each partner school.</li>
						<li>Once in contact with each other, schools jointly identify their priorities for the partnership and agree the educational outcomes they seek to achieve.</li>
						<li>Regular methods of communication between each school are agreed eg texting by mobile phone, Email or Skype.</li>
						<li>Partner schools together develop a long term plan and timetable for their partnership.</li>
						<li>The international partnership becomes part of each school’s Development Plan.</li>
						<li>Partner schools run activities which introduce global themes to their pupils (see <a title="School Partnership Activities" href="partnershipsActivities.php">Suggested Partnership Activities</a>).</li>
						<li>Schools mutually develop a partnership policy to guide their work and formalize this in a Partnership Agreement that is agreed and signed by each school.</li>
						<li>One school in the partnership agrees to takes responsibility for applying for any grants to support reciprocal teacher exchanges for practicing classroom teachers (see <A href="partnershipsExchanges.php" title="Teacher Exchanges">Teacher Exchanges</a>)</li>
						<li>Partner schools register on the <a href="https://schoolsonline.britishcouncil.org/partner-school">British Council website</a> (so that other prospective partner schools can learn from their experiences).</li>
						<li>Don’t let setbacks put you off! Often there are problems such as staff changes, where a lead teacher moves to another schools.

						<hr/>
						 Once your school has decided to work towards a partnership with a Tyume Valley school, it’s important that: all staff are aware and supportive of the initiative; the partnership is integrated into your school’s improvement/development plan; there is more than one named member of staff leading the activity; and the partnership supports your school’s curriculum priorities.
			<ul>
			<li>It’s helpful when starting out to link with another local school that already has an overseas partnership. They will have useful experience and advice around practicalities and know what has worked and what hasn’t. Perhaps invite a teacher with experience of linking to a staff meeting? TVS can also provide a speaker.</li>
			<li>Involve governors and inform parents of your plans.
			</li>
			<li>Keep the focus of the partnership on learning, not providing resources for the Tyume Valley school. (It may be appropriate for a parent or local community group to take on any fundraising activities at a later date.)
			</li>
			<li>If you decide to contact any of the schools in Tyume Valley (see <a href="partnershipsTyume.php">Tyume Valley schools seeking partnership with a UK school</a>), please let TVS know so that we can support you.
			</li>
			<li>Create a plan of action: consider applying for a British Council Reciprocal Visit Grant or working towards the International School Award.
			</li>
			</ul>
