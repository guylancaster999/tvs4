					  <li>Partnerships go through a series of stages as they develop.
						<ul>
							<li>Initial contact</li>
							<li>Agreeing means and regularity of contact</li>
							<li>Identifying mutual curriculum topics that fit with Global Education</li>
							<li> Making a formal agreement</li>
							<li> Organising possible staff exchanges</li>
						</ul>
						</li>
						<li>A school in Tyume Valley wishes to form a partnership and informs TVS. It identifies what it seeks to gain from its link.</li>
						<li>Tyume Valley Schools helps to identify a suitable UK partner school.</li>
						<li>Partnership/link Co-ordinators are identified by the Headteacher/Principal in each partner school.</li>
						<li>Once in contact with each other, schools jointly identify their priorities for the partnership and agree the educational outcomes they seek to achieve.</li>
						<li>Regular methods of communication between each school are agreed eg texting by mobile phone, Email or Skype.</li>
						<li>Partner schools together develop a long term plan and timetable for their partnership.</li>
						<li>The international partnership becomes part of each school’s Development Plan.</li>
						<li>Partner schools run activities which introduce global themes to their pupils (see <A href="partnershipActivities.php">Suggested Partnership Activities</a>).</li>
						<li>Schools mutually develop a partnership policy to guide their work and formalize this in a Partnership Agreement that is agreed and signed by each school.</li>
						<li>One school in the partnership agrees to takes responsibility for applying for any grants to support reciprocal teacher exchanges for practicing classroom teachers (see <A href="partnershipExchanges.php">Teacher Exchanges</a>)</li>
						<li>Partner schools register on the <a href="https://schoolsonline.britishcouncil.org/partner-school">British Council website (so that other prospective partner schools can learn from their experiences).</li>
						<li>Don’t let setbacks put you off! Often there are problems such as staff changes, where a lead teacher moves to another schools. For more advice and support see <a href="partnershipsHelp.php">Sources of Help and Support</a>.</li>
