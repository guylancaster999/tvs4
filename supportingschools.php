TVS plays a major role in supporting schools with subject tuition and teaching methodology. 
Teacher training is an essential element of everything that we do. 
Through providing subject based workshops and working alongside teachers at study camps and in English, IT and music sessions our volunteers aim to help and support teachers in the local schools to learn new methods and develop best practice. 
We have also assisted a number of schools in setting up partnerships with UK schools and enabled teacher exchanges between those partner schools.

Since April 2007, TVS has organised introductory computer courses for teachers, groups of children and school leavers. We are now also facilitating the setting up of computer labs in schools and we employ a local IT facilitator to run courses at the Resource Centre and help schools to introduce the use of computers into their lessons.

All public exams are in English so this is vital to learning in all subject areas.

In 2011, we began a programme providing supplementary out-of-school English Language courses for primary school children. 
Selected local teachers are trained to use innovative English Language teaching methods and mentored and supervised by TVS so that they can eventually take on the mentoring of fellow teachers themselves.</div>
