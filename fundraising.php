								<h3>How can you help? </h3>
							<p> TVS relies heavily on: </p>
							<ul>
							<li> <strong>Subscriptions/standing orders from regular supporters </strong></li>
							<li> <strong>one-off donations </strong></li>
							<li>  <strong>Gift Aid </strong></li>
							</ul>
							You can:
							<ul>
							<li>Make a <strong>donation </strong>to TVS through <a href="https://mydonate.bt.com/charities/tyumevalleyschools">BT MyDonate</a>. </li>
							<LI>Post a <strong>cheque</strong> made out to Tyume Valley Schools Development Association to the Treasurer, 2 Old Blackfriars, Marley Lane, Battle, TN33 0DQ, United Kingdom	and (if true) please include the following with your donation:
							   <ul>
								 <li>&quot;Please claim Gift Aid on my donation, I confirm that:
							  <ul>
								<li>I am a UK taxpayer</li>
								<li>I have paid or will pay an amount of Income Tax and/or Capital Gains Tax for the current tax year (6 April to 5 April) that is at least equal to the amount of tax that all the charities and Community Amateur Sports Clubs (CASCs) that I donate to will reclaim on my gifts for the current tax year.
								  I understand that other taxes such as VAT and Council Tax do not qualify.
								  I understand that TVS will reclaim 25p of tax on every £1 that I have given.</li>
								  <li> This is my own money and I am not donating on behalf of a group, company or anyone else&quot;</li></ul>
								</li></ul>
							</li>
							<li>Become a<strong> regular subscriber</strong>.
							Supporting TVS as a regular donor is the   best way to help us achieve our long-term goals.
							Even a small monthly donation of £5 can make a huge difference over the longer-term.
							Click <a href="doc/Gift-Aid-Form.docx">here</a> to download a Standing Order and Gift Aid Form. </li>
							<li>Organise a<strong> fundraising event</strong> such as a car boot sale, concert or bake-off. </li>
							<li>Take part in a <strong>sponsored event</strong> such as a walk, swim, run, parachute jump or cycle ride to raise money for TVS. </li>
							<li>  <strong>Leave a gift in your will</strong>.
							  Even a very small percentage of your estate could make a real difference to TVS.
							  Your solicitor or other professional adviser will help you with the wording.
							  Click <a href="wills.php">here</a> for examples of wording you might use. </li>
							</ul>
							 Our most generous supporters are small family or business trusts, which assist with our English, IT and infrastructure costs, including:
							<ul>
							<li><a href="http://www.fergusontrust.co.uk/">The Ferguson Trust</a> </li>
							<li><a href="http://lurgantrust.org/">the Lord and Lady Lurgan Trust</a></li>
							<li>the SEM  Foundation </li>
							<li><a href="http://www.makemydaybetter.co.uk/">Make My Day Better</a>, the charitable arm of <a href="http://www.dialaflight.com/">Dial-a-Flight</a></li>
							<li><a href="http://www.thebiggive.org.uk/">The Big Give</a>, a charitable initiative of the <a href="http://thereedfoundation.org/">Reed Foundation</a>, each year enables small donors to compete for funds, which  are then matched by the Reed Foundation and, in our case Make My Day  Better.</li>
