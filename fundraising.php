<li><a id="1"></a>On Sunday 12th April 2015, there was a 3 mile sponsored walk on the Hogs Back at Puttenham, Surrey. It started at 10.00am at the car park opposite The Jolly Farmer (GU3 1AJ). Tel 01424 773360 or email <a href="mailto:Office@tvschools.org.uk">Office@tvschools.org.uk</a> to sponsor her.

<li><a id="2"></a><img  src="img/karenb.jpg"  alt="Karen Barker"  class="img-responsive img-rounded  picright"/>On 26th April 2015, Karen Barker ran the 2015 London Marathon in aid of TVS. Karen has sent an update on her training:
<blockquote>My training hit a bit of a plateau in December when I couldn't seem to get past the 13 mile mark; I was feeling a bit despondent. However, after running 15 miles early in January and then being REALLY sore afterwards I picked up some tips from a colleague. I am now a big fan of protein shakes (I used to mock their use!) and leg raises. After a long run, lying with your legs up against a wall for a few minutes is such a relief! Completing 17 miles was a big psychological breakthrough – when I realized I could run a long distance - even if it hurt (it did). Managed 20.48 miles this weekend ! </blockquote>
She completed the run in 4 hours and 52 minutes. 
Karen has so far raised &pound;2,500.

<p> TVS relies heavily on: </p>
<ul>
  <li> <strong>Subscriptions/standing orders from regular supporters </strong></li>
<li> <strong>one-off donations </strong></li>
<li>  <strong>Gift Aid </strong></li>
</ul>  
You can:
<ul>
<li>Make a <strong>donation </strong>to TVS through <a href="https://mydonate.bt.com/charities/tyumevalleyschools">BT MyDonate</a>. </li>
<li>Become a<strong> regular subscriber</strong>.  Supporting TVS as a regular donor is the   best way to help us achieve our long-term goals. Even a small monthly   donation of £5 can make a huge difference over the longer-term. Click <a href="doc/Gift-Aid-Form.docx">here</a> to download a Standing Order and Gift Aid Form. </li>
<li>Organise a<strong> fundraising event</strong> such as a car boot sale or concert. </li>
<li>Take part in a <strong>sponsored walk/run/cycle ride</strong> to raise money for TVS. </li>
<li>  <strong>Leave a gift in your will</strong>. Even a very small percentage of your estate could make a real difference to TVS. Your solicitor or other professional adviser will help you with the wording. Click <a href="wills.php">here</a> for examples of wording you might use. </li>
