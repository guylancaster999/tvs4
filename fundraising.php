							Support our Great North Run competitor!
							<br/>
							<br/>
							Diana Tottle will be competing in the Great North Run – 13.1 miles from Newcastle upon Tyne to South Shields – in aid of TVS. Diana has sent an update on her training:
							<blockquote>
							Training for a recent mini-triathlon felt a bit of a digression until another Great North Runner told me that triathlon training is idea for marathons - and even half marathons! 
							The complete body workout means you don't put so much stress on the same muscles and joints. 
							Being lucky enough to live near the Peak district also means I have lovely views to distract me from the pain as I train!
							<br/>
							<br/>
							The mini-triathlon itself was a big high! 
							I'd wisely been very cautious about my swimming speed and ended up being slotted in with the slowest in the pool at the unearthly start-time of 7.20am on a Sunday morning! 
							Still - at least it meant that it was all over by 9.30am when I and fellow triathlete Claire, were joined by friends for a very welcome second breakfast. 
							I was very proud to have come in 2nd in my category (ie the crusty and wrinkly 55-60 year olds). 
							Please don't ask how many were in the category....
							<br/>
							<br/>
							Two	weeks post-triathlon, I am camping with family in Wales and it is time to focus on serious distances. 
							My maximum run to date has been about 6 miles. 
							The local OS map provides a good 7.5 mile loop but it’s a lot hillier in reality than it looks on paper. 
							7.5 miles nearly kills me. 
							What will 13 be like...?!
							<br/>
							<br/>
							Back in Sheffield, a friend has offered to lend me proper road running shoes. Jim, my partner, is working hard developing language teaching resources for the training he and other volunteer plan to do for TVS in South Africa in September. 
							He does his work - I mine!
