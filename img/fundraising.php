<strong>Organise a Fundraising  Event </strong><br />
Perhaps you could take part in a sponsored walk/run/cycle  ride to raise money for TVS?  Or organise  a car boot sale or concert?   <strong></strong><br />
<br/> 
<strong>Leave a Gift in your  Will </strong>
<br />
Even a very  small percentage of your estate could make a real difference to TVS.  Your solicitor or other professional adviser  will help you with the wording, but if you want to leave a gift to TVS here is  an example of some wording you might use:
<ul>
<li><strong>For a residuary gift: &lsquo;</strong>I give all  (or a….% share of) the residue of my estate to Tyume Valley Schools, 2 Old Blackfriars, Marley Lane, Battle, East  Sussex, TN33 0DQ Registered Charity 1103909,  to be used for its general charitable purposes  and I declare that the receipt of their Treasurer or other proper officer shall  be a full and sufficient discharge.&rsquo;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>For a pecuniary gift: </strong>&lsquo;I give the sum of £ (words &amp; figures) to  Tyume Valley Schools, 2 Old Blackfriars, Marley Lane, Battle, East  Sussex, TN33 0DQ Registered Charity 1103909,   to  be used for its general charitable purposes and I declare that the receipt of  their Treasurer or other proper officer shall be a full and sufficient  discharge.&rsquo;</li>
</ul></div>
